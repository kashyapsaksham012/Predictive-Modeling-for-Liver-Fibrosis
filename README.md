# 🩺 Predictive Modeling for Liver Fibrosis

Welcome to the **Predictive Modeling for Liver Fibrosis** repository! This project leverages modern machine learning techniques to predict the severity of liver fibrosis using medical data. With a focus on interpretability and fairness, it empowers healthcare professionals and data scientists to understand, evaluate, and trust predictive outcomes.

## 🚀 Features

- **Comprehensive ML Pipeline:** End-to-end workflow from data ingestion to model deployment.
- **Medical Domain Feature Engineering:** Extracts meaningful, medically relevant features (ratios, composite scores, etc.).
- **Multiple Model Support:** Trains and compares XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Ensemble models.
- **Interpretability:** Harnesses SHAP and LIME for global and local feature importance analysis.
- **Fairness & Subgroup Analysis:** Evaluates model performance across demographics (gender, age) for ethical AI.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Utilizes SMOTE and advanced sampling techniques for robust results.
- **Automated Reporting:** Saves models, metrics, and analysis artifacts for reproducibility.

## 🧬 How It Works

1. **Setup:** Installs all required libraries automatically.
2. **Data Upload & Validation:** Supports Google Colab and local file systems with thorough CSV validation.
3. **Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, duplicates, scaling, and feature engineering.
4. **Severity Score Creation:** Leverages dimensionality reduction (UMAP/PCA) to derive a fibrosis severity score.
5. **Model Training & Evaluation:** Fits, tunes, and compares multiple regression models.
6. **Interpretability & Fairness:** Uses SHAP/LIME and subgroup analysis to explain and validate predictions.
7. **Results Saving:** Serializes models, metrics, and explanations for future use.

## 📊 Example Use Case

1. Upload your patient data as a CSV.
2. The pipeline processes the data, creates new features, and trains several models.
3. Receive predictions, model explanations, and fairness reports.
4. Download trained models and automated reports.
